            <p>While running TalentQL, we realised that there was a huge knowledge gap with some of the software engineers who passed through our vetting process, when it came to understanding basic things about software engineering.</p>
            <p>A lot of them were self-taught and while they had gone on to gain good technical skills, some foundational knowledge was missing..</p>
            <p>So, we decided to make things easier by creating a school that is not fully a school. An alternative to school. Here you can, in under a year, learn and gain a certification in a myriad of disciplines to give you a great foundation as well as the start you need to go for your dream tech career.</p>
            <p>Our Mission is to help you get started on the career you want. Whether you are fresh out of high school, seeking extra education, or want to transition to a career in tech, We will give you the skills and insight to achieve the success you desire.</p>
